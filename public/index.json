As a Linux desktop user, I love talking about Linux and sharing my experiences with it. Since I\u0026rsquo;m a science student, you\u0026rsquo;ll also find some blog posts about science-related topics here. Additionally, I’ll occasionally recommend books that I think are worth reading.\n","date":"15 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" How to Switch from Windows to Linux # Switching from Windows to Linux is an exciting step toward learning more about how your computer works and enjoying the power and flexibility Linux offers. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or someone simply seeking a more efficient operating system, here’s a step-by-step guide to help you make the transition.\nWith Windows 10 reaching end of life in 2025 and Windows 11 not being supported on many older computers, now may be the perfect time to make the switch to Linux, which can run on a wide range of hardware.\n1. Choose a Linux Distribution (Distro) # Linux comes in many different versions, known as distributions (distros). Some of the most popular beginner-friendly distros include:\nUbuntu: Very user-friendly, widely supported. Linux Mint: Another great option for beginners, with a Windows-like interface. Fedora: Great for those who want a more cutting-edge experience. Debian: Stable and reliable, but may require more technical know-how. You can try different ones with live USBs (without installing them) to see which you like best.\n2. Create a Backup # Before making any changes, back up all your important data (documents, photos, videos, etc.) to an external hard drive or cloud storage. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose any files during the switch.\n3. Create a Bootable USB with Your Chosen Distro # Download the ISO image of your selected Linux distro from its official website. Use a tool like Rufus (Windows) or Balena Etcher (cross-platform) to create a bootable USB drive. 4. Test Linux Without Installing (Optional) # Boot your computer from the USB drive by selecting the USB as the boot device in the BIOS/UEFI settings (usually accessible by pressing F2, F12, or ESC during startup). Most distros allow you to \u0026ldquo;Try\u0026rdquo; Linux before actually installing it, so you can test out the interface, hardware compatibility, and see if it suits your needs. 5. Install Linux # Once you\u0026rsquo;re ready to install, follow these steps:\nStart the installation process from the bootable USB. Select your language and keyboard layout. Choose the installation type: If you\u0026rsquo;re completely replacing Windows, choose the option to erase the disk and install Linux. If you want to keep Windows and create a dual-boot system, choose the option to install alongside Windows. Set your timezone, username, and password. Wait for the installation to complete. This process may take a while, depending on your hardware. 6. Set Up Your System # After the installation, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install any software you want, such as browsers, office suites, media players, etc. Popular options include:\nWeb browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Brave Office suites: LibreOffice, OnlyOffice Email clients: Thunderbird Media players: VLC Graphics: GIMP, Inkscape You can usually install software using a package manager like apt (for Ubuntu/Debian-based distros) or dnf (for Fedora).\n7. Install Additional Drivers (If Necessary) # Linux usually works well with most hardware out-of-the-box, but sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install proprietary drivers (like for graphics cards or Wi-Fi).\nFor example, on Ubuntu, you can go to Software \u0026amp; Updates and enable additional drivers. You can also search for driver packages using your distro\u0026rsquo;s package manager.\n8. Learn the Basics of Linux # The Linux terminal is a powerful tool. You\u0026rsquo;ll likely use it for tasks like updating your system or installing software. Here are a few essential commands:\nUpdate your system: sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade (for Ubuntu/Debian-based distros). Install software: sudo apt install \u0026lt;software-name\u0026gt;. Check system info: uname -r. Familiarize yourself with the file system. Linux has a different structure than Windows, but it’s fairly easy to get used to.\n9. Migrate Your Files # Once you have Linux up and running, you can begin migrating your files back from the backup you created earlier. If you were dual-booting, you could access your Windows partition from Linux and copy files directly.\n10. Enjoy Your New Linux System # Now that everything is set up, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to explore Linux! Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner or an advanced user, there’s a thriving community around Linux, so don’t hesitate to search for help online if needed.\nAdditional Tips: # If you ever run into problems, the Linux community (forums, Reddit, StackExchange) is usually very helpful. Consider joining Linux-related forums or subreddits to stay up to date with tips and tricks. If you need a software replacement for something you used in Windows, there are usually Linux alternatives (e.g., GIMP for Photoshop, LibreOffice for Microsoft Office).
