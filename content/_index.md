Hello everyone! Welcome to *The Personal Blog*, where I share interesting and fun incidents from my day-to-day life. As a Linux desktop user, I love talking about Linux and sharing my experiences with it. Since I'm a science student, you'll also find some blog posts about science-related topics here. Additionally, Iâ€™ll occasionally recommend books that I think are worth reading.
